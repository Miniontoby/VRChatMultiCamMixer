## 🎉 Publishing a Release

You can make a release by running the [Build Release](.github/workflows/release.yml) action. The version specified in your `package.json` file will be used to define the version of the release.

## 📃 Rebuilding the Listing

Whenever you make a change to a release - manually publishing it, or manually creating, editing or deleting a release, the [Build Repo Listing](.github/workflows/build-listing.yml) action will make a new index of all the releases available, and publish them as a website hosted fore free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This listing can be used by the VPM to keep your package up to date, and the generated index page can serve as a simple landing page with info for your package. The URL for your package will be in the format `https://username.github.io/repo-name`.

## 🏠 Customizing the Landing Page (Optional)

The action which rebuilds the listing also publishes a landing page. The source for this page is in `Website/index.html`. The automation system uses [Scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban) to fill in the objects like `{{ this }}` with information from the latest release's manifest, so it will stay up-to-date with the name, id and description that you provide there. You are welcome to modify this page however you want - just use the existing `{{ template.objects }}` to fill in that info wherever you like. The entire contents of your "Website" folder are published to your GitHub Page each time.
